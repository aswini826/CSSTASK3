      <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
        The orginal meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible 
        plant matter ,including the flowers,fruits,stems,leaves,roots,and seeds.An alternative definition of the term is applied
        somewhat arbitrarily ,often by culinary and cultural tradition.It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are
        fruits,flowers,nuts and cereal grains ,but include savouary fruits such as tomatoes and courgetters,
        flowers such as brocoli,and seeds such as pulses.<br>
        Orginally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gathers and entered cultivation in several
        parts of the world ,probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agriculture way of life 
        developed.
        At First,plants which grow locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on ,trade brought exotic
        crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types.Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate
        permits,and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations.
